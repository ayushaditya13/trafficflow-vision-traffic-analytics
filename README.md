TrafficFlow Vision: Traffic Analytics | Python · Ultralytics · OpenCV · Microsoft Excel · PowerBI 

• Collaborated with a team of 3 to develop a prototype system that can estimate road traffic volume, the data obtained 
would lead to data driven insights and actions to optimize traffic management, reducing congestion, and improving travel 
time leading to enhanced urban mobility and economic productivity. The outcome of the project was 85% accuracy in 
predicting traffic flow patterns by leveraging libraries like Ultralytics and OpenCV for real-time vehicle detection and 
classification.
• Implemented data cleansing, data modelling and feature engineering, utilizing Python and Excel pivot tables, to
analyze traffic data effectively.
• Integrated data with PowerBI to construct responsive dashboards for stakeholders and policy makers for enabling
them to take data-driven actions.
• Demonstrated strong leadership, communication and problem-solving skills with vision for success of the project.
